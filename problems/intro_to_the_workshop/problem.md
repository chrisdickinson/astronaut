Welcome to {bold}astronaut{/bold}, a workshop which will help you
think about your code at an AST level. AST stands for Abstract Syntax
Tree, which is how your computer thinks about your source code. It's
really similar to the browser's DOM, so javascript people should feel
right at home.

To get familiar for how the tutorial works, let's start with a
{italic}hello world{/italic}.

Write a node program that accepts two command-line arguments, and
prints out (with {bold}console.log(){/bold}):

    ASTs are {bold}WORD1{/bold} and {bold}WORD2{/bold}.

You can test your program with:

    {bold}{appname} run your_program.js{/bold}

and verify it's correct with:

    {bold}{appname} verify your_program.js{/bold}

After you've verified it, you can run `{bold}{appname}{/bold}` and
select the next problems.
