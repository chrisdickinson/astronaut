  Welcome to astronaut, a workshop which will help you think about your
  code at an AST level. AST stands for Abstract Syntax Tree, which is
  how your computer thinks about your source code. It's really similar
  to the browser's DOM, so javascript people should feel right at home. 
  To get familiar for how the tutorial works, let's start with a hello 
  world.
  
  
  Write a node program that accepts two command-line arguments ({bold}X{/bold} and
  {bold}Y{/bold}), and prints out:
  
      ASTs are {bold}X{/bold} and {bold}Y{/bold}.
  
  You can test your program with:
  
      {bold}{appname} run your_program.js{/bold}
  
  and verify it's correct with:
  
      {bold}{appname} verify your_program.js{/bold}
  
  After you've verified it, you can run `{bold}{appname}{/bold}` and select the 
  next problem.
