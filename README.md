A [nodeschool style workshop](http://nodeschool.io) for understanding ASTs.

Goes through searching using ASTs, manipulating your code, etc. 


# Thanks

Inspired by prior art, including
[rvagg/levelmeup](https://github.com/rvagg/levelmeup), including a
fairly direct port of their first module. Thanks for the leg up!
